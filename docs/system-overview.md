# System Overview — How the Whole Thing Works

A tour of the moving parts and how data flows between them. For the plain-English
version see `backend-eli5.md`; for *why* each choice was made see
`architecture.md`.

## Two apps, one product

Roastmap is a directory of Canadian specialty-coffee roasters. It's two
codebases that deploy independently:

| | Repo | Runs on | Public URL |
|---|---|---|---|
| **API + admin** | `coffee-tracker-laravel` (this repo) | Fly.io | `api.roastmap.ca` |
| **Web app** | `coffee-tracker-react` | Vercel | `roastmap.ca` |

The React app is what visitors see. It holds no data of its own — it asks the
Laravel API for everything over HTTP (JSON). The Laravel app owns the database,
the nightly scraping, all email, and the operator's admin pages.

DNS is Namecheap (Advanced DNS host records); transactional email is
SMTP2GO over plain SMTP. Deploy details live in `deploy.md`.

## The data model

```
roasters ─1──∞─ coffees ─1──∞─ coffee_variants
   │                │
   │                └──────────── scraper_rejection_log   (variants we refused to import)
   │
users ─1──∞─ tastings (soft-deletes)   tastings.flagged_by_user_id → users
   │
   └─1──∞─ wishlist (unique user_id + coffee_id)

system_heartbeats   (standalone key→timestamp store the health probe reads)
```

- A **coffee_variant** is a (coffee, bag-weight) pair with its own price and
  in-stock flag — e.g. a Yirgacheffe in 250g / 1kg.
- **Roasters** also carry location/quality columns: `street_address`,
  `latitude`/`longitude`, `address_source` (`jsonld` / `website` / `osm` /
  `google` / `manual`), `is_online_only`, and import bookkeeping
  (`last_import_status`, `last_import_error`, `last_imported_at`). Address
  resolution is a cascade (scraped JSON-LD → contact page → Nominatim search →
  an optional Google Places fallback that's off unless `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY`
  is set).
- In **dev** the database is `database/database.sqlite` (seeded with a handful of
  BC roasters). In **prod** it's the same SQLite engine on a Fly persistent
  volume at `/data/database.sqlite`.

## Flow 1 — a visitor loads the site

```
Browser → roastmap.ca (React on Vercel)
        → GET api.roastmap.ca/api/... (JSON)
        → Laravel route → Controller → Eloquent query → SQLite
        ← JSON response ← React renders
```

Anything personal (your wishlist, posting a tasting) carries an
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Tokens are pure Sanctum tokens
(`config/sanctum.php` → `'guard' => []`): validated against the DB row only, no
session/cookie, no CSRF surface. Public reads (the directory, a coffee page) need
no token.

The admin pages (`/admin/*`, server-rendered Blade) are a separate world, gated
by HTTP Basic auth (`admin.basic` middleware) — independent of the React app's
token auth.

## Flow 2 — the nightly import (the heart of the system)

```
schedule (11:00 UTC)
  → php artisan roasters:import-all
    → for each active roaster with a website:
        RoasterImporter
          → ScraperRegistry picks a scraper (cached per roaster, most
            specific first): Shopify / WooCommerce / Squarespace /
            GenericHtml (JSON-LD)
          → fetch catalogue
          → syncCoffees():   upsert by (roaster_id, source_id),
                             soft-remove (removed_at) coffees that vanished
          → syncVariants():  upsert by (coffee_id, bag_weight_grams),
                             stamp in_stock_changed_at on stock flips,
                             reject impossible prices → scraper_rejection_log
          → stamp last_import_status / last_import_error / last_imported_at
```

**Why upsert-not-replace:** user tastings point at a coffee's primary key. Drop
and re-insert would orphan every tasting. So existing rows are updated in place,
and disappeared rows are *soft-removed* (kept, marked "no longer sold") rather
than deleted. This is the single most important invariant in the codebase.

**The sanity gate:** `syncVariants()` drops variants with a non-positive price or
an out-of-band price-per-gram, recording each in `scraper_rejection_log`. That
table is a snapshot of the *latest* import per roaster, so it answers "what's
currently being dropped" — a tripwire for a roaster site whose layout drifted.

## Flow 3 — scheduled work (app/Console/Kernel.php)

| When (UTC) | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| daily 11:00 | `roasters:import-all` | the nightly catalogue refresh above |
| daily 11:30 | `reports:daily-ops` | emails the daily ops summary (see below) |
| daily 14:00 | `alerts:restock` | emails users whose wishlisted beans returned |
| Mon 13:00 | `reports:weekly-digest` | deeper weekly data-quality audit email |
| Mon 13:30 | `coffees:purge-non-coffee --apply` | weekly backstop soft-removing gear rows the filter now rejects |
| 1st 12:00 | `roasters:scrape-addresses` | monthly address / geocode sweep |
| every 5 min | `scheduler-heartbeat` | bumps `scheduler.tick` so `/up` can tell the scheduler is alive |

The scheduler runs *inside* the Fly container: `docker/entrypoint.sh` launches
`php artisan schedule:work` in a restart loop, and `fly.toml` keeps one machine
always on (`auto_stop_machines = 'off'`). If `schedule:work` died, none of the
above would fire — which is exactly why the heartbeat + `/up` exist.

## Flow 4 — observability (knowing when nothing's working)

Three independent layers, each catching a different failure class:

1. **Infrastructure — `GET /up`** (`HealthController`). Returns **200 healthy**
   when the database is reachable *and* `scheduler.tick` is fresh (< 15 min old);
   **503 degraded** otherwise. An external uptime monitor (UptimeRobot / Better
   Stack) polls it and pages you on a non-200. This is the only signal that
   catches a *silently dead scheduler* — the worst failure, because the web app
   still looks fine while the catalogue quietly goes stale. The body also reports
   informational-only checks (`mail.last_sent`, `imports.errors`) that never flip
   the status.
2. **Data/work — the daily ops email** (`reports:daily-ops`). Roasters added in
   the last 24h, active roasters failing import (with the error), outstanding
   variant rejections, and mail-delivery confirmation. It sends every day, so its
   reliable arrival is itself a "mail + scheduler are alive" signal.
3. **Code — Sentry** (`app/Exceptions/Handler.php`). Uncaught exceptions are
   reported to Sentry. Inert until `SENTRY_LARAVEL_DSN` is set (a Fly secret), so
   it's silent in dev. `/up` is excluded from tracing so monitor polling doesn't
   flood it.

Liveness signals are stored in `system_heartbeats` (a key→timestamp table):
`scheduler.tick` (bumped every 5 min by the scheduler, seeded at boot by the
entrypoint) and `mail.sent` (bumped by the `RecordMailSent` listener whenever the
mail transport accepts a message).
